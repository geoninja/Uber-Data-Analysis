## **Analysis of Uber's Ridership Data for NYC.**

Early in 2017, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission [(TLC)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) released a dataset about Uber's ridership between September 2014 and August 2015. The data contains features distinct from those in the set previously released and throughly explored by FiveThirtyEight and the [Kaggle community](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). Check the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/geoninja/Uber-Data-Analysis/blob/master/NYC_Uber_Rides.ipynb) in this repository to see the contents of the data. 


**This project aims to:**
* visualize Uber's ridership growth in NYC during the period
* characterize the demand based on identified patterns of the time series
* estimate the value of the NYC market for Uber, and its revenue growth
* other insights about the usage of the service
* attempt to predict the demand's growth beyond 2015


## **Publication**
The analysis and the visualizations produced in the Jupyter Notebook provide support for the story to be presented in the project's page (refer to link when available).



## **Required Packages**

The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook with a Python 2.7 kernel, and in addition it requires the following packages:

* [Numpy](http://numpy.org) (version: 1.11.2)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)(version: 0.19.2)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)(version: 1.5.3)
* [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org) (version: 0.6.0)
